# Chapter 4 Processor Architecture

## 4.1 The Y86-64 Instruction Set Architecture 391

Instruction set architecture (ISA)

the ISA provides a conceptual layer of abstraction between compiler writers, who need only know what instructions are permitted and how they are encoded, and processor designers, who must build machines that execute those instructions.

- Intel IA32 and x86-64
- IBM/Freescale Power
- ARM processor family
  
This idea of using clever tricks to improve performance while maintaining the functionality of a simpler and more abstract model is well known in computer science. 

Examples 
- caching in Web browsers 
- information retrieval data structures such as balanced binary trees and hash tables.
