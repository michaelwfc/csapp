Instead of using a global seed, it uses a pointer to a seed (nextp) passed in by the caller.

This means each thread (or even each function call) can maintain its own independent seed.

The caller is responsible for allocating and managing nextp.

If each thread uses its own unsigned int nextp, there's no shared state, and no chance of a race condition.
